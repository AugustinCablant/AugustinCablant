# Welcome to my Github profile ! 

## Some words about me
**Master student** at Ensae Paris (National School of Statistics and Economic Administration) in statistics and machine learning. I am strongly interested in statistics, Machine Learning, Data Science and Sports science. I plan to continue my studies and then my professional career in these fields.

## Iâ€™m currently working on : 
- Estimating the survival function of life annuity sellers ([just here](https://github.com/AugustinCablant/Estimation-non-param-trique-et-mod-les-de-survie/blob/main/Fonction%20de%20survie/estimation_fonction_survie.R)) and maximum likelihood ([just here](https://github.com/AugustinCablant/Estimation-non-param-trique-et-mod-les-de-survie/blob/main/Vraissemblance/Vraissemblance.ipynb))  as part of a first-year internship at CREST (python and R)
- Improving my skills in Machine Learning (scikit learn, PyTorch, Tensor Flow ...) [My notes](https://github.com/AugustinCablant/Learning-ML/blob/main/MACHINE_LEARNING.pdf)
- A challenge data organized by ENS and QRT [Have a look](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/97/)
- A challenge data organized by ENS and CFM [Have a look](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/84/)

## Iâ€™m currently learning : 
- python
- R
- STATA
- C++

## âš¡ My future projects : 
- a C++ project during my first semester
- Statapp during the year (Statapp is an applied statistics project organised at ENSAE. This project takes place during the second year of ENSAE)
